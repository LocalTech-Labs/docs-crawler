# License & Pricing

Remotion is **free to use** if you are:

- an individual
- a for-profit organisation with up to 3 employees
- a non-profit or not-for-profit organisation
- evaluating whether Remotion is a good fit, and are not yet using it in a commercial way

If you don't qualify for any of the above, you need to acquire a company license. Visit [remotion.pro](https://remotion.pro) for pricing and buying a license.

When in doubt, read the [LICENSE file](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/blob/main/LICENSE.md) and the [Company License FAQ](https://www.remotion.pro/faq) before using Remotion. You can contact [us](mailto:hi@remotion.dev) if you need clarification whether you can use Remotion in your project for free.
