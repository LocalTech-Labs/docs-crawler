# Preview your video

You can preview your video by starting the [Remotion Studio](/docs/studio):

- Regular templates
- Next.js and Remix templates

```

bash

npm run dev
```

```

bash

npm run dev
```

```

bash

npm run remotion
```

```

bash

npm run remotion
```

This is a shorthand for the [`studio`](/docs/cli/studio) command of the [Remotion CLI](/docs/cli):

```

bash

npx remotion studio
```

```

bash

npx remotion studio
```

A server will be started on port `3000` (or a higher port if it isn't available) and the Remotion Studio should open in the browser.

In older projects, `npm start` was used over `npm run dev`.
