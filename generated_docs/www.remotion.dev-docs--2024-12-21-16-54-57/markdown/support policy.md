Get helpSupport PolicyOn this pageSupport PolicyThe Remotion team provides no guarantee for support, and you should not hold the expectation to receive any help.
However, we welcome you to ask questions and invest a lot of time into answering them.
Follow the steps below if have a question that you would like to get answered.
How to ask for help​
See here for channels where you can ask for help as well as for best practices for asking questions.
Prioritized support​
Company license customers can get a  Company License badge on Discord for each Developer Seat they subscribe to. The badge can be activated on remotion.pro.
If posted in a public channel, the Remotion team will try to prioritize your question, albeit no guarantee of support is given.
We still expect company license subscribers to follow the best practices for asking questions outlined above.
Paid consulting​
Our Remotion Experts are available for technical advice and guidance. With their extensive experience in creating Remotion projects, they will surely be of great help.
You can also request a consultation session with Remotion's creator here.
This is the only way to receive support via video call fom the Remotion team.
When we can't help​
We don't provide support if:

the guidelines above were not followed
low effort was put into first solving the problem yourself
your question is lacking reproduction or information
the cause of problems is due to poor React or JavaScript skills
our Code of Conduct is violated

Remotion is targeted towards developers and therefore basic skills in React and web development are expected.
You should also be mindful of the limitations of those technologies as we cannot help you overcome them.
