# useVideoTexture()

Allows you to use a video in React Three Fiber that is synchronized with Remotion's `useCurrentFrame()`.

To use a video in a Three.JS context, you first have to render it and assign it a ref. If you only want to use it in a React Three Fiber Scene, you can make it invisible by adding a `{position: "absolute", opacity: 0}` style.

```

tsx

import { useRef } from "react";
import { Video } from "remotion";
import src from "./vid.mp4";

const MyVideo = () => {
  const videoRef = useRef<HTMLVideoElement | null>(null);

  return (
    <Video
      ref={videoRef}
      src={src}
      style={{ position: "absolute", opacity: 0 }}
    />
  );
};
```

```

tsx

import { useRef } from "react";
import { Video } from "remotion";
import src from "./vid.mp4";

const MyVideo = () => {
  const videoRef = useRef<HTMLVideoElement | null>(null);

  return (
    <Video
      ref={videoRef}
      src={src}
      style={{ position: "absolute", opacity: 0 }}
    />
  );
};
```

To convert the video to a video texture, place the `useVideoTexture()` hook in the same component.

```

tsx

import { useVideoTexture } from "@remotion/three";

// ...

const texture = useVideoTexture(videoRef);
```

```

tsx

import { useVideoTexture } from "@remotion/three";

// ...

const texture = useVideoTexture(videoRef);
```

The return type of it is a `THREE.VideoTexture | null` which you can assign as a `map` to for example `meshBasicMaterial`. We recommend to only render the material when the texture is not `null` to prevent bugs.

```

tsx

{
  videoTexture ? <meshBasicMaterial map={videoTexture} /> : null;
}
```

```

tsx

{
  videoTexture ? <meshBasicMaterial map={videoTexture} /> : null;
}
```
