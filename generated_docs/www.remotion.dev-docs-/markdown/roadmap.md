# Roadmap

Buying the Recorder includes access to all future updates.

Here is a list of things that we plan to add.

We actively develop the Recorder because we use it for our own videos, however we do not put dates on these features.

We recommend that you only buy the Recorder if you find it useful in its current state or plan to develop the missing features yourself.

## ✅ SRT export [​](\#-srt-export "Direct link to ✅ SRT export")

The convention on YouTube is to provide subtitles in the form of an `.srt` file instead of burning them in.

We plan to add this as a Remotion feature and then enable it in the Recorder.

note

This has been released as of June 23rd, 2024!

## 9:16 format [​](\#916-format "Direct link to 9:16 format")

We plan to support a new format that makes the videos feel native on Instagram, YouTube Shorts and TikTok.

- Different layout for webcam and display
- Word-by-word captions
- Animating the captions

## Improving the editing experience [​](\#improving-the-editing-experience "Direct link to Improving the editing experience")

We plan to add new Remotion APIs and Remotion Studio features to make edits easier than having to use the props editor.

## Give us feedback [​](\#give-us-feedback "Direct link to Give us feedback")

Let us know on the [`#recorder`](https://remotion.dev/recorder) channel what you would like to see next.
