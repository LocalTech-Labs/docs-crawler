# Transitions

To transition from one scene to another, set the `transitionToNextScene` checkbox in the right sidebar.

Transitions between two consecutive video scenes will only occur if the layout changes from one scene to the next. For example, if the webcam is positioned in the top left corner in the first video scene and in the bottom left corner in the next video scene.

Going from one scene type to a different scene type, there is always a transition if `transitionToNextScene` is checked.
