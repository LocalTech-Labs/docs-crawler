# Multiple buckets in Remotion Cloud Run

EXPERIMENTAL

Cloud Run is in [Alpha](/docs/cloudrun-alpha), which means APIs may change in any version and documentation is not yet finished. See the [changelog to stay up to date with breaking changes](https://remotion.dev/changelog).

Remotion Cloud Run supports **1 bucket per region and project** that you use Remotion Cloud Run in. It is not necessary to create multiple buckets because:

- A Cloud Storage bucket is an effectively infinitely scalable storage solution.
- Remotion will perfectly isolate each render so they do not interfere with another.
- You can give sites a unique identifier to separate production and development environments.
- The Remotion Cloud Run service is a binary that does not change with your codebase.

You might intuitively create multiple buckets because you have multiple environments, but it is usually not needed.

## Deleting extraneous buckets [â€‹](\#deleting-extraneous-buckets "Direct link to Deleting extraneous buckets")

If you got an error message

```

You have multiple buckets [remotioncloudrun-1a2b3c4d, remotioncloudrun-howDidThisHappen] in your Cloud Storage region [us-east1] starting with "remotioncloudrun-".
```

```

You have multiple buckets [remotioncloudrun-1a2b3c4d, remotioncloudrun-howDidThisHappen] in your Cloud Storage region [us-east1] starting with "remotioncloudrun-".
```
