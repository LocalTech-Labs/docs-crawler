# serializeInstructions()

_Part of the [`@remotion/paths`](/docs/paths) package. Available from v3.3.40_

Takes an array of [`Instruction`](/docs/paths/parse-path)'s and serializes it into an SVG path string.

```

serialize-instructions.ts
tsx

import { serializeInstructions } from "@remotion/paths";

const newPath = serializeInstructions([
  {
    type: "M",
    x: 10,
    y: 10,
  },
  {
    type: "L",
    x: 20,
    y: 20,
  },
]); // M 10 10 L 20 20
```

```

serialize-instructions.ts
tsx

import { serializeInstructions } from "@remotion/paths";

const newPath = serializeInstructions([
  {
    type: "M",
    x: 10,
    y: 10,
  },
  {
    type: "L",
    x: 20,
    y: 20,
  },
]); // M 10 10 L 20 20
```

This function may throw if the instructions don't match the [`Instruction`](/docs/paths/parse-path) type, but it does not explicitly check for invalid input.
