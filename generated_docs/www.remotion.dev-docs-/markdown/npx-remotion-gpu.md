# npx remotion gpu

_Available from Remotion v4.0.52_

Prints out how the Chrome browser uses the GPUs.

```

bash

npx remotion gpu --gl=angle
```

```

bash

npx remotion gpu --gl=angle
```

The command takes the same arguments for `--gl` as `npx remotion render` and also picks up the [`Config.setChromiumOpenGlRenderer()`](/docs/config#setchromiumopenglrenderer) option.

Try out different values to find which one is the best for your system.

```
