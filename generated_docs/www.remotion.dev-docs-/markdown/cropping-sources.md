# Cropping sources

Sometimes you only want to record a portion of your screen.

For example: You don't want the dock and menu bar of your Mac to be recorded.

The best way to achieve this is to create a virtual camera using [OBS](https://obsproject.com/).

[1](#1)

Download [OBS from their website](https://obsproject.com/) and install it.

[2](#2)

Open OBS and click on `Settings` -\> `Video`.
Set as both the "Base Resolution" and Canvas Resolution the resolution of your
desired output. We recommend 1920x1080. Click on `OK`.

[3](#3)

Under `Sources`, add your display.

[4](#4)

Crop the video by dragging on the corners of the video.

[5](#5)

Click on `Start Virtual Camera`.

[6](#6) In the Remotion [Recording interface](/docs/recorder/record/), you can now select "OBS Virtual Camera" as the source.
