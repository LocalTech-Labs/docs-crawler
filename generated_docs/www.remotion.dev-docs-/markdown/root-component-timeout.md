# Root component Timeout

If you get an error message:

```

A delayRender() "Loading root component" was called but not cleared after 28000ms
```

```

A delayRender() "Loading root component" was called but not cleared after 28000ms
```

You have specified an [entry point](/docs/terminology/entry-point) that does not call [`registerRoot()`](/docs/register-root).

In most of the templates, the entry point is `src/index.ts`.

- Maybe you have specified the list of compositions ( `src/Root.tsx` in most templates) instead.
- Maybe you have specified the filename of a component that you want to render.

Ensure that you are passing the file that calls [`registerRoot()`](/docs/register-root) as the entry point.

In the CLI, the entry point is passed as an argument to the render command:

```

npx remotion render [entry-point]
```

```

npx remotion render [entry-point]
```

In the [`bundle()`](/docs/bundle) and [`deploySite()`](/docs/lambda/deploysite) Node.JS apis, you pass the entry point via the [`entryPoint`](/docs/terminology/entry-point) property.
