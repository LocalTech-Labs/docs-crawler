To use the Recorder, you only need a laptop with a webcam and a microphone.

If you want to level up your production, there are endless possibilities.

Here is the setup that Jonny uses to record his videos.

## PC [​](\#pc "Direct link to PC")

A Windows PC is being used to record the footage.

This is to offload the strain from recording videos and keeping the laptop fast while showing its screen.

## Camera [​](\#camera "Direct link to Camera")

A Panasonic Lumix S5 with a 20-60 mm lens is mounted on a tripod.

The camera is being connected to the PC with an HDMI cable going into an Elgato Cam Link 4K capture card.

The [Lumix Tether](https://av.jpn.support.panasonic.com/support/global/cs/soft/download/d_lumixtether.html) app is being used to set the focus and exposure from the PC.

## Screen [​](\#screen "Direct link to Screen")

The screen of the M2 Macbook Air is being recorded through an HDMI cable being fed into a Elgato Game Capture HD60X.

Because this also captures the menu bar and the macOS dock, the feed is being added to OBS where it is being cropped to 16:9.

The Remotion Recording interface is then using the OBS Virtual Camera as a source.

## Microphone [​](\#microphone "Direct link to Microphone")

A RØDE NT-USB microphone is being plugged into the PC.

The microphone is mounted on an RØDE PSA1 arm.

## Lights [​](\#lights "Direct link to Lights")

Two Amaran 200x S lights are being used to light Jonny from both sides.

They are each wrapped in a Aputure Light Dome Mini II (54.61cm) softbox.
