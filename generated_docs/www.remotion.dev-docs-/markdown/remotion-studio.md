# Remotion Studio

The [Remotion Studio](/docs/studio) is the editor that opens that when you run [`npx remotion studio`](/docs/cli/studio).

It allows for fast editing and playback of [compositions](/docs/terminology/composition).

It is included in the [`@remotion/cli`](https://npmjs.org/packages/@remotion/cli) package.

Not to be confused with the [Remotion Player](/docs/player).

You can [deploy the Remotion Studio](/docs/studio/deploy-server) to render on a VPS.

Since v4.0.93, the Studio is also embedded in every [Remotion Bundle](/docs/terminology/bundle), albeit it does not support rendering.

## Remotion Preview [​](\#remotion-preview "Direct link to Remotion Preview")

The former name of the Remotion Studio, renamed in v4.0.0.

Since the Preview gained more capabilities than just previewing, the name was not fitting anymore.
