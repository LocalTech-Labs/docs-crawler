# convertToCaptions() [v4.0.131](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/releases/v4.0.131)

This API was deprecated as of Remotion 4.0.216.

It is recommended to use the [`toCaptions()`](/docs/install-whisper-cpp/to-captions) function from `@remotion/install-whisper-cpp` instead, and then process the captions using [`createTikTokStyleCaptions()`](/docs/captions/create-tiktok-style-captions) from [`@remotion/captions`](/docs/captions).

[Click here](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/blob/v4.0.215/packages/docs/docs/install-whisper-cpp/convert-to-captions.mdx) to see documentation for this function that was previously on this page.
