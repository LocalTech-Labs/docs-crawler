# Remotion Root

The Remotion Root is the directory in which Remotion commands get executed in.

It influences the default location of the [public dir](/docs/terminology/public-dir), the `.env` file and the [config file](/docs/config) amongst others.

## Which directory is the Remotion Root? [â€‹](\#which-directory-is-the-remotion-root "Direct link to Which directory is the Remotion Root?")

To determine the Remotion Root, take the directory from which you execute commands or run scripts, and go upwards until you hit a directory that contains a `package.json` file.

Many Remotion CLI commands also print the Remotion Root directory if you pass `--log=verbose`.
