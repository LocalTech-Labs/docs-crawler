# useCurrentScale() [v4.0.125](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/releases/v4.0.125)

With this hook, you can retrieve the scale factor of the canvas.

Useful for if you want to [measure DOM nodes](/docs/measuring).

In the [Studio](/docs/terminology/studio), it will correspond to the zoom level - the value is `1` if the zoom is at 100%.

In the [Player](/docs/terminology/player), it will correspond to the scale that is needed to fit the video canvas in the Player.

```

MyComp.tsx
tsx

import { Sequence, useCurrentScale } from "remotion";

const MyVideo = () => {
  const scale = useCurrentScale();

  return <div>The current scale is {scale}</div>;
};
```

```

MyComp.tsx
tsx

import { Sequence, useCurrentScale } from "remotion";

const MyVideo = () => {
  const scale = useCurrentScale();

  return <div>The current scale is {scale}</div>;
};
```

If you are outside of a Remotion context, the hook will throw an error.

If you want to avoid this error and return a default scale, you can pass an options object with the property `dontThrowIfOutsideOfRemotion` set to `true`.

In this case, the hook will return `1`.

```

MyComp.tsx
tsx

import { useCurrentScale } from "remotion";

const MyRegularReactComponent = () => {
  const scale = useCurrentScale({ dontThrowIfOutsideOfRemotion: true });

  return <div>The current scale is {scale}</div>;
};
```

```

MyComp.tsx
tsx

import { useCurrentScale } from "remotion";

const MyRegularReactComponent = () => {
  const scale = useCurrentScale({ dontThrowIfOutsideOfRemotion: true });

  return <div>The current scale is {scale}</div>;
};
```
