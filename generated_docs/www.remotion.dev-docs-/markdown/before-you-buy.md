# Before you buy

The Remotion Recorder is a first-of-its-kind JavaScript-based video creation tool where you are in control of the source code.

## Skills required [​](\#skills-required "Direct link to Skills required")

To create a video with the Recorder, you need to be able to:

- Clone a Git repository
- Execute commands in the command line
- Open a project in a code editor

The more skilled of a developer you are, the more you are able to customize the Recorder to your needs.

## Do I need to know how to code? [​](\#do-i-need-to-know-how-to-code "Direct link to Do I need to know how to code?")

For creating a video in the default style, you do not need to code.

However, the Recorder is appealing to developers, because of the customization that is possible by modifying the code.

## Who is this for? [​](\#who-is-this-for "Direct link to Who is this for?")

The Recorder is for content creators who want to fully own their workflow and find value in the flexibility of using code to generate videos.

It works best for creators who film their face and their screen to create technical content (screencasts and courses).

The Recorder does not have a comparable feature set to traditional video editors.

## For companies [​](\#for-companies "Direct link to For companies")

The Recorder is governed under [the same license as Remotion](/docs/license).

If you do not fall under the free license, you need subscribe to the company license to use Remotion and therefore the Recorder.

Good news: The company license includes the Remotion Recorder!
