### Title Scene [​](\#title-scene "Direct link to Title Scene")

A title consists of the main title and an optional subtitle.
The subtitle can be removed by checking the `null` checkbox in the right side.

### Video Scene [​](\#video-scene "Direct link to Video Scene")

A video scene contains a webcam recording, an optional screencast and captions, if [generated](/docs/recorder/captions). Each recording captured with the recorder corresponds to one video scene.
For each newly added video scene, the chronologically next recording will be added to the timeline.

The webcam can be positioned in either one of the four corners of the video. The other components will be automatically positioned around the webcam.

### Endcard [​](\#endcard "Direct link to Endcard")

In the endcard you can add call to actions, such as links to your social media profiles or other websites.
