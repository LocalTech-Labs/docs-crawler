# VERSION

You may import this constant to get the current version of Remotion.

Only the version of the [`remotion`](/docs/remotion) package will be reported.

A [version conflict](/docs/cli/versions) with other Remotion packages cannot be ruled out.

```

Importing VERSION from remotion
ts

import { VERSION } from "remotion";

console.log(VERSION); // "4.0.57";
```

```

Importing VERSION from remotion
ts

import { VERSION } from "remotion";

console.log(VERSION); // "4.0.57";
```

You can also import it from `remotion/version` to avoid importing Remotion and its dependencies (i.e, `react` and `react-dom`):

```

Importing VERSION from remotion/version
ts

import { VERSION } from "remotion/version";

console.log(VERSION); // "4.0.57";
```

```

Importing VERSION from remotion/version
ts

import { VERSION } from "remotion/version";

console.log(VERSION); // "4.0.57";
```
