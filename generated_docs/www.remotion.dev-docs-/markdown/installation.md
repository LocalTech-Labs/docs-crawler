# Installation

To install the Player, run the following command in a React project:

- npm
- yarn
- pnpm
- bun

```

npm i --save-exact @remotion/player@4.0.242Copy
```

```

npm i --save-exact @remotion/player@4.0.242Copy
```

```

pnpm i @remotion/player@4.0.242Copy
```

```

pnpm i @remotion/player@4.0.242Copy
```

```

bun i @remotion/player@4.0.242Copy
```

```

bun i @remotion/player@4.0.242Copy
```

```

yarn --exact add @remotion/player@4.0.242Copy
```

```

yarn --exact add @remotion/player@4.0.242Copy
```

This assumes you are currently using v4.0.242 of Remotion.

Also update `remotion` and all `` `@remotion/*` `` packages to the same version.

Remove all `^` character in front of the version numbers of it as it can lead to a version conflict.
